= A poor man's tool to compare CORBA IDL

The tool tries to compile IDLs to Java (base and new sets) into jars and compares resulting jars with https://github.com/melix/japicmp-gradle-plugin[japicmp gradle] plugin.

== How to use

. Put base IDLs to `idlBase` directory
. Put new IDLs to `idlNew` directory
. Run `./gradlew japicmp`
. See comparison report at `build/reports/japicmp/report.txt`
